# Canvas testing
[demo](https://erfre.github.io/canvas_testing/)
A unfinished game I wrote to expand my understanding of classes, animation and the canvas element.

## Installation


1. Download the code
2. Open the index.html in browser
3. Use either keypad or wasd + space to play


### History/Explanation

This was the second time I played around with the canvas element.
This time trying to learn how to do animations(which 2048 lacked). This is also where I started to get a grasp classes.

The biggest things this small project taught me were classes, animation, collision checking and finally how 2d platformers worked.

This was just a simple test so the code is really unpolished and unfinished but it's pretty easy to understand except for the weird structure.
I have not changed this code or added any comments since it was first written.
